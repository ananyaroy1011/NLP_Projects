Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.

Each document is modeled as a multinomial distribution of topics and each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution of words.
LDA assumes that the every chunk of text we feed into it will contain words that are somehow related. Therefore choosing the right corpus of data is crucial.
It also assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution.
Step 1: Load the dataset
The dataset we'll use is the 20newsgroup dataset that is available from sklearn. This dataset has news articles grouped into 20 news categories

In [27]:
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', shuffle = True)
newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test', shuffle = True)
In [28]:
print(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))
['alt.atheism', 'comp.graphics', 'comp.os.ms-windows.misc', 'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware', 'comp.sys.mac.hardware', 'comp.windows.x', 'misc.forsale', 'rec.autos', 'rec.motorcycles', 'rec.sport.baseball', 'rec.sport.hockey', 'sci.crypt', 'sci.electronics', 'sci.med', 'sci.space', 'soc.religion.christian', 'talk.politics.guns', 'talk.politics.mideast', 'talk.politics.misc', 'talk.religion.misc']
As you can see that there are some distinct themes in the news categories like sports, religion, science, technology, politics etc.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
We will perform the following steps:

Tokenization: Split the text into sentences and the sentences into words. Lowercase the words and remove punctuation.
Words that have fewer than 3 characters are removed.
All stopwords are removed.
Words are lemmatized - words in third person are changed to first person and verbs in past and future tenses are changed into present.
Words are stemmed - words are reduced to their root form.

Step 4: Running LDA using Bag of Words
We are going for 10 topics in the document corpus.

We will be running LDA using all CPU cores to parallelize and speed up model training.

Some of the parameters we will be tweaking are:

num_topics is the number of requested latent topics to be extracted from the training corpus.
id2word is a mapping from word ids (integers) to words (strings). It is used to determine the vocabulary size, as well as for debugging and topic printing.
workers is the number of extra processes to use for parallelization. Uses all available cores by default.
alpha and eta are hyperparameters that affect sparsity of the document-topic (theta) and topic-word (lambda) distributions. We will let these be the default values for now(default value is 1/num_topics)

Alpha is the per document topic distribution.

High alpha: Every document has a mixture of all topics(documents appear similar to each other).
Low alpha: Every document has a mixture of very few topics
Eta is the per topic word distribution.

High eta: Each topic has a mixture of most words(topics appear similar to each other).
Low eta: Each topic has a mixture of few words.
passes is the number of training passes through the corpus. For example, if the training corpus has 50,000 documents, chunksize is 10,000, passes is 2, then online training is done in 10 updates:

#1 documents 0-9,999
#2 documents 10,000-19,999
#3 documents 20,000-29,999
#4 documents 30,000-39,999
#5 documents 40,000-49,999
#6 documents 0-9,999
#7 documents 10,000-19,999
#8 documents 20,000-29,999
#9 documents 30,000-39,999
#10 documents 40,000-49,999

Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?
